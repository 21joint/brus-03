      <p>2023 Partners, in partnership with Medical Alley Association, the industry association of over 700 health care businesses globally, and Walmart, is hosting the inaugural Manova Global Summit in Medical Alley which aims to bring together 2,000 thought leaders, executives, entrepreneurs and technologists who are playing at the crossroads of consumer health, global health, retail and medical technology.<br><br>The three-day event featuring high-profile speakers, panels and networking events will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota October 8 -10, 2018.<br><br>Why Now – Why the Twin Cities<br><br>First and foremost, the Twin Cities are the epicenter of all things health, the preeminent global leader in health, health technology and medical science. This area, dubbed ‘Medical Alley’ is home to the world’s #1 health center, with a list of leading health companies: Mayo Clinic, UnitedHealth, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, 3M, Ecolab, Abbott, Coloplast, Cantel Medical, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and many others. The Twin Cities area also leads in venture funding and investment in health startups globally. Health-related employment is pegged at $16 billion in annual payrolls and comprises nearly 30% of the region’s employment.<br><br>So you see, ‘Medical Alley’ is a real place - just like Silicon Valley. Medical Alley has the same kind of global impact and the same kind of global promise. So, similar to Silicon Valley, we believe that this annual Global Summit can position Medical Alley as the thought leader on the future of all things in health and health care.<br><br>Second, health and health care are at an historic moment, moving from a largely business-to-business model to a business-to-consumer model. Consumers today are aggressively employing the power of technology and seeking new innovation to solve their health and wellness challenges and opportunities. Every aspect of health care is being redefined at the intersection of empowered consumers, technology and retail. We are standing at the precipice of an explosion of new ideas and new ways of doing old things, and things we never imagined.<br><br>Third, there is broad support for an industry-led summit based here that focuses on the future of health care. We have major global companies like Walmart that are stepping up to be presenting sponsors and we are building a world-class program of thinkers for our inaugural event.<br><br>The summit will feature cutting edge industry keynote speakers who are making news today in rewriting the healthcare delivery to consumers. We will also have 4 tracks of discussion panels that will give you an opportunity to learn, discuss and weight in.
